I'm a first-year master student of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at University of [Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/). My track is Signal Processing & Machine Learning.

My research interests lie broadly in Multi-modal Learning, e.g., Multi-modal Representation Learning, Multi-modal Generation and Multi-modal LLM.

I am actively seeking academic collaborations. Please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in working together.
