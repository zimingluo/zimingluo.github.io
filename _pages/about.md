👋 Welcome to my page! I’m a second-year Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, specializing in Signal Processing and Machine Learning.

🔍 My research focuses on advancing LLM-based systems with an emphasis on enabling explainable and faithful reasoning across modalities. I am passionate about leveraging my expertise in large language models and computer vision to drive innovation in autonomous scientific experimentation, interdisciplinary AI techniques, and the alignment of AI with human values.

👀 I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position and would be excited to explore potential opportunities. If you have any openings or would like to discuss possibilities, please don’t hesitate to shoot me an email!
