👋 Welcome to my page! I earned my Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) in 2024, with a specialization in machine learning and natural language processing.

🔍 My research focuses on advancing LLM-based systems, with an emphasis on enabling explainable and faithful reasoning across modalities. I am passionate about designing intelligent agents that not only excel in processing and integrating diverse data modality, but also align closely with human values.

👀 I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position and would be excited to explore potential opportunities. If you have any openings or would like to discuss possibilities, please don’t hesitate to shoot me an email!
